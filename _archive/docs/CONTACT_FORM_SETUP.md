### HTML Form Setup
```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true" data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field">
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact">
  <input type="hidden" name="bot-field" style="display: none;">
  
  <!-- Form fields as specified in WEBSITE_COPY.md -->
</form>
```

### Form Validation Rules
**Client-side validation:**
- Name: Required, min 2 characters
- Email: Required, valid email format
- Organization: Optional, max 100 characters
- Project Type: Required, dropdown selection
- Message: Required, min 10 characters, max 1000
- Budget Range: Optional, dropdown selection

### Success/Error Handling
**Success Page:** `/thank-you.html`

- Return to homepage link

**Error Handling:**
