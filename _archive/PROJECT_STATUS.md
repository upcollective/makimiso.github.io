# PROJECT STATUS SUMMARY FOR CLAUDE CODE

## 🎯 MISSION
Transform the current functional Makimiso website into a visually compelling showcase that demonstrates Paolo's 15+ years of design expertise while serving nonprofit and educational clients.

## ✅ WHAT'S ALREADY WORKING
- **Content Strategy**: Excellent messaging and positioning
- **HTML Structure**: Clean, semantic markup
- **Accessibility Foundation**: WCAG 2.1 AA ready
- **Responsive Grid**: Functional layout system
- **Brand Colors**: Professional palette defined
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Form validation, mobile nav, basic animations
- **Typography**: Inter font system implemented

## ❌ WHAT NEEDS MAJOR IMPROVEMENT
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Everything looks flat and uniform
- **Professional Design Showcase**: Doesn't demonstrate Paolo's expertise
- **Engaging Elements**: Missing animations, interactions, visual interest
- **Service Icons**: Generic emojis instead of custom graphics
- **Hero Section**: Plain gradient, no visual engagement
- **Statistics Display**: Basic text instead of animated, compelling presentation

## 🎨 THE CORE CHALLENGE
**Current Problem**: The website looks like it was built by a developer, not a 15+ year design expert.
**Business Impact**: Nonprofit clients won't trust this agency with their mission-critical communications.
**Solution**: Make the website itself a portfolio piece that demonstrates design capabilities.
